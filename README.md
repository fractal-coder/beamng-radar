# Installation
Method 1 is the normal way to install mods on BeamNG.drive; you can try Method 2 if you have problems using the app in mods like kissmp. 
## Method 1
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/rasmus4/beamng-radar/releases) of `radar.zip` and place it in `My Documents\BeamNG.drive\mods`.

## Method 2
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/rasmus4/beamng-radar/releases) of `radar.zip`, and extract the folder `radar` (under `ui\modules\apps\`) to `\PATH\TO\STEAM\steamapps\common\BeamNG.drive\ui\modules\apps\radar`.

For example, if steam is installed on the `C:\` drive with the default install path, extract the folder `radar` to

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\BeamNG.drive\ui\modules\apps\radar`.


The resulting file structure should be like this:
```
+-- modules
|   +-- apps
|   |   +-- radar
|   |   |   +-- app.json
|   |   |   +-- app.js
|   |   |   +-- app.png
```
